# Getting Help

If you have any questions, feel free to post them in [Slack](http://slack.feathersjs.com/), submit them as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues) or on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs) using the [feathersjs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs) tag. We are also on IRC in the [#feathersjs](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=feathersjs) channel on Freenode.

We are also collecting tutorials and news on Medium in the ["All About FeathersJS"](https://medium.com/all-about-feathersjs) publication.
