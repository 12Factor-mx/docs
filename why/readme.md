# Why Feathers

If you went through the [Getting Started](../getting-started/readme.md) section you probably saw just how quick it is to get an application off the ground. 

Using Feathers is quite simply the fastest way to build scalable, real-time web and mobile applications. You can literally build prototypes in minutes and production ready applications in days.

Feathers achieves this by being a thin wrapper over top of some amazing battle tested open source technologies and adding a few core pieces like [Hooks](../hooks/readme.md) and [Services](../services/readme.md).

If you've decided that Feathers might be for you, feel free to [dive right in](../getting-started/readme.md). If you're still unsure about what Feathers does and where it comes from you can learn more about the [Feathers philosophy](philosophy.md), see [what Feathers offers](features.md),  or check out [how Feathers compares to others](vs/readme.md).
