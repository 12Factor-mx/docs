# Building a Frontend

Feathers works great with any client that can connect through HTTP/HTTPS to a REST API or websockets. Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make an existing front-end turn real-time.

Feathers is also [universally usable](../clients/feathers.md) in most JavaScript environments like the Browser, other NodeJS servers or React Native. This makes it very easy to integrate with many JavaScript libraries. In the [guides section](../guides/readme.md) we put together a growing list of integration guides to build real-time frontends for the chat API we created in this chapter:

- [jQuery](../guides/jquery.md) and ES6 strings for templates

If you don't see your favourite framework, do not despair yet! We have more information how to use a Feathers API on the client in the [Client Use](../clients/readme.md) chapter and we're always [open for suggestions and questions](../help/readme.md).
