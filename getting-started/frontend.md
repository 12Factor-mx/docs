# Building a Frontend

A Feathers server works great with any client that can connect through HTTP(S) or websockets to a REST API. Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make an existing front-end turn real-time.

Feathers is also universally usable and provides a [JavaScript client](../clients/feathers.md) that works in the Browser, React Native or other NodeJS servers. This makes it very easy to integrate with many JavaScript libraries and client side frameworks. In the [guides section](../guides/readme.md) we've put together a growing list of integration guides to build real-time front-ends for the chat API we created in this chapter:

- [jQuery Feathers Chat](../guides/jquery.md)
- [React Feathers Chat](../guides/react.md)
- [React Native Feathers Chat](../guides/react-native.md)

If you don't see your favourite framework, do not despair! We have more information how to use a Feathers API on the client in the [Client Use chapter](../clients/readme.md) and we're always open for [suggestions and questions](../help/readme.md).
