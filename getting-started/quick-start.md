# Quick Start

The following guide will walk through creating a basic Todo REST and websocket API with Feathers. To get started, lets create a new folder and in it run

> `npm install feathers`

## Your first service

The most important concept Feathers adds to Express is that of *services*. Services can be used just like an Express middleware function but instead are JavaScript objects that provide at least one of the following methods:

```js
var myService = {
  find: function(params, callback) {},
  get: function(id, params, callback) {},
  create: function(data, params, callback) {},
  update: function(id, data, params, callback) {},
  patch: function(id, data, params, callback) {},
  remove: function(id, params, callback) {},
  setup: function(app, path) {}
}
```

This object can be registered like `app.use('/my-service', myService)` which - if configured - makes it available as a REST endpoint at `/my-service` and also through websockets. As usual in NodeJS, `callback` has to be called with the error (if any) first and the data as the second parameter.

## Simple Todo

With those methods available we can implement a very basic Todo service that returns a single Todo using the id passed to the `get` method:

```js
// app.js
var feathers = require('feathers');
var app = feathers();
var todoService = {
  get: function(id, params, callback) {
    // Call back with no error and the Todo object
    callback(null, {
      id: id,
      text: 'You have to do ' + id + '!'
    });
  }
};

app.configure(feathers.rest())
  .use('/todos', todoService)
  .listen(3000);
```

After running

> `node app.js`

You can go to [localhost:3000/todos/dishes](http://localhost:3000/todos/dishes) and should see the following JSON response:

```js
{
  "id": "dishes",
  "text": "You have to do dishes!"
}
```

## What's next?

This are the basics of Feathers. We created a todos API that is accessible via REST and websockets and built a real-time jQuery frontend. Now, head over to the **[Learn section](/learn)** to learn more about things like Databases, how to integrate other frontend frameworks, Validation, Authentication or Authorization and get familiar with the **[API documentation](/api/)**.
