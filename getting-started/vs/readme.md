# Feathers vs. Other Software

You're probably wondering how Feathers compares to all the other real-time technology stacks out there. We've written up some comparisons to highlight the similarities and differences between them and Feathers.

Due to the bias of these comparisons being on the Feathers website, we attempt to only use facts. If you find something invalid or out of date in the comparisons, please [create an issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/issues/new) (or better yet, a pull request) and we'll address it as soon as possible.
