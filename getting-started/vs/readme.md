# Feathers vs. Other Software

This section compares Feathers to other software choices that seem similar or may overlap with the use cases of Feathers.

Due to the bias of these comparisons being on the Feathers website, we attempt to only use facts. If you find something invalid or out of date in the comparisons, please [create an issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/issues/new) (or better yet, a pull request) and we'll address it as soon as possible.
