# Feathers + jQuery

In this guide we will create a jQuery frontend for the chat API from the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/first-app.md).

We haven't had time to publish this guide yet. If you feel like you could contribute one feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/edit/master/guides/jquery.md).
