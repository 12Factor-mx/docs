# Generating an app

Let's write a new project using the Feathers generators.

This project will have users and teams.
A user may belong to zero, one or more teams.
We will want to display teams with all their members.

## Create the app

The first thing we do is generate the basic app using:
![Generate app](../assets/gen-app.jpg)
