# Generating an app

Now let's write a new project using the Feathers generators.

This project has users who may be members of one or more teams.
We want to display teams with all their members.

## Create the app

The first thing we do is generate the basic app using:
![Generate app](../assets/gen-app.jpg)

This generated [code](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/auk/examples/step/02/gen1/)
with the structure:
![Generate app structure](../assets/gen-app-dir.jpg)
