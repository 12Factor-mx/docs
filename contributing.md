# Help Us Write the Book!

Just like Feathers, itself, all of the documentation is open source and [available to edit on GitHub](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs).  If you see something that you can contribute, we would LOVE a pull request with your edits!

## Contributing Guidelines

The docs are all written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).  If you've used GitHub, it's pretty likely you've encountered it before.  You can become a pro in a few minutes by reading their [GFM Documenation page](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

### Organizing Files

You'll notice that the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs) is organized in a simple, flat, file structure.  Each file is prefixed with the chapter number.  For example, this contributing guide is named `01_contributing.md`.  Some of the chapters are split into multiple sections.  The `real-time` chapter spans multiple files, so the first is `05.0_real-time.md` and the following sections are prefixed with `05.1`, `05.2`, etc.  The numbering system helps keep things organized for the next person that wants to edit the docs, so please keep any file edits nicely numbered.

### Managing the Table of Contents

[SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) = Table of Contents.

You'll find the table of contents in the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) file.  It's a list of markdown links.  You can link to a file simply by putting the filename (including the `.md` extension) inside the link parentheses.

So that's it. You make your edits, keep your files and the Table of Contents organized, and send us a pull request.

### The Introduction Page

Intro Page = [README.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/README.md)

If you feel like you want to give the introduction page some shine and polish, you'll find it in the [README.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/README.md).

### Enjoy the Offline Docs
Moments after your edits are merged, they will be automatically published to the web, as a downloadable PDF, .mobi file (Kindle compatible), and ePub file (iBooks compatible).
