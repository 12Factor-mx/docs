# Help Us Write the Book!

Just like Feathers, itself, all of the documentation is open source and [available to edit on GitHub](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs).  If you see something that you can contribute, we would LOVE a pull request with your edits!

## Contributing Guidelines

The docs are all written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).  If you've used GitHub, it's pretty likely you've encountered it before.  You can become a pro in a few minutes by reading their [GFM Documenation page](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

### Organizing Files

You'll notice that the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs) is organized in a simple, flat, file structure.  The first file in each chapter is named as a description of the entire chapter's topic.  For example, this contributing guide is named `contributing.md`.  Some of the chapters are split into multiple sections. All subsections are prefixed with the same topic, separated by a `.`.  So, because the `providers` chapter spans multiple files, the first file is named `providers.md`, the next section is `providers.rest.md`, etc.  This naming system helps keep chapters together in the file system.  In order to see the chapter ordering, you'll need to open the table of contents file.

### Table of Contents

[SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) = Table of Contents.

You'll find the table of contents in the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) file.  It's a nested list of markdown links.  You can link to a file simply by putting the filename (including the extension) inside the link target.

### Introduction Page

Intro Page = [README.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/README.md)

If you feel like you want to give the introduction page some shine and polish, you'll find it in the [README.md](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/blob/master/README.md).

### Send a Pull Request
So that's it. You make your edits, keep your files and the Table of Contents organized, and send us a pull request.

### Enjoy the Offline Docs
Moments after your edits are merged, they will be automatically published to the web, as a downloadable PDF, .mobi file (Kindle compatible), and ePub file (iBooks compatible).
