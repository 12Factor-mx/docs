We've been collecting some commonly asked questions here. We'll either be updating the guide directly, providing answers here or both.

## I heard Express is dying. What about Koa/Hapi/X?

Koa is a *"next generation web framework for Node.JS"* using ES6 generator functions instead of Express middleware. This approach unfortunately does not  play well with current Feathers services so there are no direct plans yet to use it as a future base for Feathers.

However, we have discussed making Feathers framework agnostic, especially considering what is occurring with Express, so we are watching [this issue](https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2844) closely.

## Can I expose custom service methods?

## How do I do nested routes?

## How do I return related entities?
