With Feathers it's easy to create scalable, real-time applications.  Make creating web and mobile apps fun with Feathers.

Using Feathers is a great way to build scalable, real-time web and mobile applications. You can literally build prototypes in minutes and production ready applications in days. Feathers achieves this by being a thin wrapper over top of some amazing battle tested open source technologies and adding a few core pieces like [Hooks](../../api/hooks.md) and [Services](../../api/services.md).

If you've decided that Feathers might be for you and you haven't tried the tutorial, feel free to dive right in and [learn about the basics](../step-by-step/readme.md). If you're still unsure about what Feathers does and where it comes from see [what Feathers offers](./features.md), learn more about the [Feathers philosophy](./philosophy.md) or check out [how Feathers compares to others](./vs.md).
