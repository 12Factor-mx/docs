# Using With Front-end Frameworks

Feathers works with your favorite frameworks.

# Frameworks

Feathers works great with any front-end that connects through HTTP/HTTPS or websockets to your Feathers REST API. Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make a front-end turn real-time. To help you out we've provided some simple TodoMVC style examples and guides that all connect to the same Feathers real-time API (todos.feathersjs.com):

 - [jQuery](http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/jquery/)
 - [React](http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/react/)
 - [Angular](http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/angularjs/)
 - [CanJS](http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/canjs/)

If you don't see your favorite framework, create an issue or - even better - a pull request and we'll try our best to make it happen.
