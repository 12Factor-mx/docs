# Vanilla REST

Once [set up on the server](../rest/readme.md), there are several ways to connect to the REST API of a Feathers service. Keep in mind that while clients connected via websockets will receive real-time events from other REST API calls, you can't get real-time updates over the HTTP API without resorting to polling.

You can communicate with a Feathers server using any HTTP REST client. The following section describes what HTTP method, body and query parameters belong to which service method call.

All query parameters in a URL will be set as `params.query` on the server. Other service parameters can be set through [hooks](../hooks/readme.md) and [Express middleware](../middleware/express.md). URL query parameter values will always be strings. Conversion (e.g. the string `'true'` to boolean `true`) can be done in a hook as well.

The body type for `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests is determined by the Express [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) middleware which has to be registered *before* any service. You should also make sure you are setting your `Accepts` header to `application/json`.

### find

Retrieves a list of all matching resources from the service

```
GET /messages?status=read&user=10
```

Will call `messages.find({ query: { status: 'read', user: '10' } })` on the server.

### get

Retrieve a single resource from the service.

```
GET /messages/1
```

Will call `messages.get(1, {})` on the server.

```
GET /messages/1?fetch=all
```

Will call `messages.get(1, { query: { fetch: 'all' } })` on the server.

### create

Create a new resource with `data` which may also be an array.

```
POST /messages
{ "text": "I really have to iron" }
```

Will call `messages.create({ "text": "I really have to iron" }, {})` on the server.

```
POST /messages
[
  { "text": "I really have to iron" },
  { "text": "Do laundry" }
]
```

### update

Completely replace a single or multiple resources.

```
PUT /messages/2
{ "text": "I really have to do laundry" }
```

Will call `messages.update(2, { "text": "I really have to do laundry" }, {})` on the server. When no `id` is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:

```
PUT /messages?complete=false
{ "complete": true }
```

Will call `messages.update(null, { "complete": true }, { query: { complete: 'false' } })` on the server.

> **ProTip:** `update` is normally expected to replace an entire resource which is why the database adapters only support `patch` for multiple records.

### patch

Merge the existing data of a single or multiple resources with the new `data`.

```
PATCH /messages/2
{ "read": true }
```

Will call `messages.patch(2, { "read": true }, {})` on the server. When no `id` is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:

```
PATCH /messages?complete=false
{ "complete": true }
```

Will call `messages.patch(null, { complete: true }, { query: { complete: 'false' } })` on the server to change the status for all read messages.

This is supported out of the box by the Feathers [database adapters](../databases/readme.md) 

### remove

Remove a single or multiple resources:

```
DELETE /messages/2?cascade=true
```

Will call `messages.remove(2, { query: { cascade: 'true' } })`. When no `id` is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:

```
DELETE /messages?read=true
```

Will call `messages.remove(null, { query: { read: 'true' } })` to delete all read messages.
